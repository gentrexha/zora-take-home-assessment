COLLECTOR CHURN PREDICTION - MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
=====================================================

METHODOLOGY
• Evaluation Strategy: 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation
• This approach provides a more robust estimate of model performance.

📊 KEY BUSINESS METRICS
• Mean Model Accuracy (AUROC): 0.488 (± 0.023) ❌ Weak
• Mean Precision@Top10%: 30.0% (± 6.32%)
• Interpretation: Of users flagged as highest churn risk, we can expect 30.0% to actually churn on average.

🎯 ACTIONABILITY
• Target 20 users for retention campaigns (based on a single data split)
• Expected to capture ~6 churners
• Focus interventions on top risk factors below

🔍 TOP CHURN DRIVERS (from final model trained on all data)
  1. weekend_activity_ratio: 0.063
  2. comment_rate: 0.055
  3. meaningful_collection_ratio: 0.049
  4. social_engagement_score: 0.048
  5. collection_size_variance: 0.047

📈 BUSINESS IMPACT POTENTIAL
• Current model can identify 30.0% of high-risk churners with good reliability.
• Recommended for further development
• Focus retention efforts on top 10% risk users for maximum ROI
