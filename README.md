## TODO: Write up

Brief
Write a short one-pager explaining your analysis.
It should cover:
● Approach and methodology: Explain your high-level approach to analyzing the
data and predicting churn and your rationale for it.
● Data analysis: What are the key insights from the data? What patterns or trends do
you notice?
● Model development: Describe the model you developed to predict churn. Which
features did you select, and why?
● Evaluation metrics: Which business-facing metric did you choose to evaluate?
Why?
● Interpretation of results: What conclusions can you draw? What are the most
significant factors influencing churn?
● Strategic recommendations: What are three product actions you would take to
reduce churn? How would you prioritize them?
● Limitations and considerations: Discuss any limitations of your analysis and how
they might impact your conclusions.
