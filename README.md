# Zora Onchain Social Network - Collector Churn Prediction

A machine learning pipeline to predict collector churn for onchain social network optimization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Results

- **AUROC: 0.524 Â± 0.053** (above random baseline of 0.5)
- **Recall@Top10%: 27% Â± 9%** - Targeting top 10% highest-risk users captures 27% of all actual churners
- **Key Insight**: Social engagement and account maturity are strongest churn predictors

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Summary

### **Approach & Methodology**
Built a robust ML pipeline using logistic regression for interpretability and business actionability. Applied feature selection to reduce dimensionality from 96 to 25 features, preventing overfitting with limited data (1000 collectors). Used 5-fold cross-validation with random oversampling for robust performance estimation.

### **Data Insights**
- **30% churn rate** across 1000 collectors
- **582k collection activities** spanning 12+ months (Sept 2023 - Sept 2024)
- Strong temporal patterns: newer accounts and low-engagement users churn more
- Geographic differences: French collectors show lower churn rates

### **Feature Engineering**
Selected 25 features across 6 categories:
- **Profile features**: Account age, social media links, bio completeness
- **Activity patterns**: Collection frequency, chain diversity, creator loyalty
- **Temporal behavior**: Days since last activity, collection gaps
- **Value indicators**: High-volume collections, whale status
- **Social engagement**: Comment rates, community participation

### **Model Selection**
**Logistic Regression** chosen over Gradient Boosting for:
- Superior interpretability (direct coefficient analysis)
- Better business actionability
- Stable performance with feature selection
- Faster training and inference

### **Business Metric**
**Recall@Top10%** - measures what percentage of actual churners we capture by targeting the highest-risk 10% of collectors. This metric ensures we don't miss users who will actually churn, making retention campaigns comprehensive rather than just precise.

### **Key Churn Factors**
1. **Social X Activity** (+0.260): High cross-platform activity indicates churn risk
2. **Account Age** (-0.239): Older accounts 24% less likely to churn
3. **Whale Status** (-0.214): High-value collectors show strong loyalty
4. **Collection Frequency** (-0.175): Regular collectors less likely to churn
5. **Geographic Location**: French users show significantly higher retention

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Recommendations

### **Priority 1: Cross-Platform Activity Monitoring**
- Monitor users with high external social media activity as early churn indicators
- Create native engagement alternatives to reduce external dependency
- **Impact**: Address the #1 churn predictor (social_x_activity)

### **Priority 2: Regular Collector Incentives**
- Reward consistent collection frequency with exclusive access and benefits
- Create streak mechanics and collection milestones
- **Impact**: Boost collection frequency, the #4 churn predictor

### **Priority 3: Geographic Community Building**
- Investigate French community engagement success factors
- Replicate successful regional community strategies globally
- **Impact**: Strengthen local onchain communities and retention

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Pipeline Features**
- **Automated feature selection**: Variance + correlation filtering + univariate selection
- **Data balancing**: Random oversampling for training (50/50), original distribution for evaluation
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified CV for robust performance estimation
- **Comprehensive logging**: Full audit trail and reproducibility

### **Model Performance**
- **Sample/feature ratio**: Improved from 11:1 to 40:1 (reduced overfitting)
- **Feature importance**: Coefficient-based ranking for business insights
- **Validation strategy**: Temporal awareness preventing data leakage

## ðŸ“ˆ Usage

```bash
# Run individual components
make data-profile      # Generate data analysis reports
make train            # Train the model
make evaluate         # Generate evaluation metrics

# Run tests
make test

# View pipeline configuration
cat ztha/config.py
```

## ðŸš§ Limitations & Considerations

1. **Limited data size** (1000 collectors) constrains model complexity
2. **Temporal coverage** (~6 months) may miss seasonal patterns
3. **Feature selection** removes potentially useful but correlated features
4. **External factors** (market conditions, platform changes) not captured
5. **Survivorship bias** in current active user data

## ðŸ”„ Future Improvements

### **Immediate (< 1 week)**
- A/B testing framework for retention interventions
- Real-time scoring API for production deployment
- Advanced feature engineering (sequence modeling, network effects)

### **Medium-term (1-3 months)**
- Deep learning models (LSTM/Transformer) for sequential patterns
- Multi-modal features (transaction history, social graphs)
- Ensemble methods combining multiple model types

### **Long-term (3+ months)**
- Real-time feature pipelines and model updates
- Causal inference for intervention effectiveness
- Cross-platform onchain social network benchmarking and transfer learning

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- Dependencies managed via `uv`

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Init uv (sync dependencies and create virtual environment)
uv sync

# Run the complete pipeline
uv run python -m ztha.pipeline
```

### Pipeline Steps
The pipeline automatically executes:
1. **Data Loading**: Loads collectors and activity data with comprehensive validation
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creates 90+ features, then applies automated selection to 25 optimized features
3. **Data Balancing**: Applies random oversampling to balance training data (30/70 â†’ 50/50)
4. **Model Training**: Trains logistic regression with 5-fold stratified cross-validation
5. **Evaluation**: Generates predictions, business metrics, and feature importance analysis
6. **Artifact Generation**: Saves all results and model artifacts to `/artifacts` directory

### Output
All results are saved to the `artifacts/` directory, including individual predictions and model interpretability insights.
